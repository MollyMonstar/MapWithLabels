### Introduction: 

Basically, it’s a brand new app to display information of all sorts by geolocation.  
 
1. Traditional apps, users access information firstly by type, (you get news from Twitter, get selling info from Craigslist, get short videos from Tiktok, etc) This app, however, users access information firstly by geolocation.   

2. Traditional information is based on types, isolated in different apps, health-specific apps, dating-only apps, house-finding apps, etc.. Here, it follows the geographic location, information of all sorts is available at a single map point, no need to worry about not receiving infos because the users have not installed the related app. 
 
3. For example, if you have a problem with the service of a government agent, the traditional supervision method is controlled by this agent. This agent might not provide a feedback box, might not provide a website, and the mailbox or the website might not be viewed by anyone, rendering it meaningless. But geo-marking(the comment bubbles in the example picture) is different. It's not directly controlled by any government agent, yet they can't igonre it once it become local hot spot. (Supervisors will see it clearly) 

4. Traditional social media groups people together according to celebrities/hobbies/topics, while diminishing offline neighbor relationships. Here is the reverse effect.  

5. But geo-related information, after all, will not have useful new content every day. As to daily active users,  Geo-marking should only used to attract users, and there still needs "stars-fans" system, (users subscribe a certain location, subscribe a certain channel, subscribe a certain type of information, and they will see interested infos regardless of current location, just like traditional social media), exploring system(randomly exploring locations, search by info types, hot topics/locations).  

6. Need to consider user interface .. If there are too many geo-markers, you can filter according to the type of markers, you can zoom in on the map, and you can click on a marker to access secondary display .. If there are too few markers, app can display earlier markers, and you can zoom out the map... etc  
  


### Advanced explanation: 
 
7. There is too much information, and users' reading capacity is limited. Traditional social media uses recommendation algorithms so that users only see "one type" of information. But here, user only see “one place” of information, with all types of information. It should be helpful for users to see the opinions and thoughts of various groups, and (ideally) helpful to social integration and users' physical and mental health.  
 

8. We all know that free market helps competition, so that every product/service selling is worth their price. But in essence, it relies on a feedback system. When a product/service sells too expensive, with too bad quality, users give it negative feedback/comment, and the product/service provider is forced to improve. However, in reality, many types of product/service, feedback system doesn’t work very well. Providers can use the “divide and conquer” method to sell bad quality product/service separately to their users, and each users won’t know the negative feedback/comment from the users before them. (Such as offline renting. If landlord did something disgusting to the tenant before me, there is no way I could know with traditional apps.) To help you better understand what this app brings. Here is a further imagination. (Not saying it’s viable or it’s a good thing, just help you understand above point.) Imagine one day, people can attach virtual labels to people(Like AR technology, but the augmented labels stays with the people you attach to.). Whenever you meet a people, you can easily read their history, all the negative/positive impression they made to other people, whether they are a good employee/employer/friend. 


9. We all know that social media brings justice, the will of people push for institution change. (Such as Rodney King event) However, for an event big enough to challenge institution, it needs national attention, which is a "limited resource”.(That is, there can’t be too many events every year to be hot topic.) In reality, we need localized hot topic. Ten people angry with a specific leader could be more helpful compared to one million of people angry with the general elite class. (And this new map app should be helpful to bring those “ten people” together.)
  

10. This app can bring many more higher leveled data. Such as, with traditional app, you can see this people is happy about a Twitter hashtag event, that people is angry about the Twitter hashtag event. But with this new app, you can see this area of people is happy about the hashtag event, that area of people is angry about it. You can see the bigger picture more easily. Which can be used for further data analysis.
